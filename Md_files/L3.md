## Vision System 

##### Maximum Field Of View "FOV" : NA
    Maximum Field Will Be COvered By the Camera 
##### Maximum Region Of intrest "ROI": NA
    Maximum Region Contains Data Needed 
##### Depth Of Field "DOF": NA
    the distance between the nearest and the furthest objects giving a focused image.
##### Working Distance "WD": NA
    the Distance Between the tip of the camera and the Surface of desired layer 
##### 2D Matrix Polarization : Balck on White 
    Property that Define that the Desired Printed Is Black with White Background Or White Object with Black Background

##### MM/Pixel Ratio @ 20 MP :

##### Camera Test 8mm Lens & 20mp sensor :
- Test Done on  the cassette Which Handle the Unit Cartons From the Bulking Pusher to the Packing Pusher 
![Vision_location](/IMG/L4/VIALLC1.png)
##### Exposure Time  @ 20MP/8mm : NA 
    The period of exposing  sensor to the desired objects  in one frame 

#### Test Results : NA 

### Mechanical System 

###### Labeller Space Exists :  
    X :     114 CM    Y :  80 CM       Z :  200 CM

![X Position](/IMG/L4/X.jpg "X : Length in the direction of Carton Movement")
            
            X : Length in the direction of Carton Movement

![Y Position](/IMG/L4/Y.jpg "Y :  Length Normal to the Movement ")

         Y :  Length Normal to the Movement 

![Z Position](/IMG/L4/Z.jpg "Z : Hight of the machine")

           Z : Hight of the machine 
###### Dimensions for Vision System Allocation  :  NA
   
### Automation System
#### Process :
 In Process
 * labeller signal will be recieved in order to send a printing command to the printer with the appropritate SSCC Serial 
 * Interphase Relay Will Be implemented in the check-ware System so that When WE Have a rejection Decision for the outer Case we will activate these Relay Cutting the Good Carton Signal to be send from the Check-ware to the robot in order to activate the Machine reject
 * SSCC Verification will be using 2 Scanning units 1 after the labeller and 1 @ the reject Station in order to scan the reject catron Caused By Checkware 
 

#### Inter-Communication Signals 
###### Casette Pusher Signal : NA 


###### Outer Case Pusher Signal :
    Location :   NA       Type: NA
###### New Carton Signal :
    Location : 170B9         Type: PNP Signal
