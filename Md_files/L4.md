### Automation System
#### Process :
 Integration with This Uholmann Case Packer Machine will Depends on Getting the Signal going to the Cassette Which Holds then By the mean of a Proximity Sensor will be implemented by Origin System We will Cut The input signal Going to the Cassete then Sending a Camera Trigger to Shoot the Desired frame then Uncut the signal again to let the machine Complete it's SOP 
 * new Carton Signal will be integrated  so that we could synchronnize our System with the machine Packing  verifying the integrity  t
 * labeller signal will be recieved in order to send a printing command to the printer with the appropritate SSCC Serial 
 * Interphase Relay Will Be implemented in the check-ware System so that When WE Have a rejection Decision for the outer Case we will activate these Relay Cutting the Good Carton Signal to be send from the Check-ware to the robot in order to activate the Machine reject
 * SSCC Verification will be using 2 Scanning units 1 after the labeller and 1 @ the reject Station in order to scan the reject catron Caused By Checkware

#### Inter-Communication Signals 
###### Casette Pusher Signal :
    Location :  will Be implemnted By origin          
    Type: Dry Contact    
    Comment: Dry Contact Signal from the customer side will Be used also as input Signal for our PLc 
###### Outer Case Pusher Signal :
    Location :   NA       Type: NA
###### New Carton Signal :
    Location : 170B9         Type: PNP Signal
###### Arm Signal For Rejecting Cartons :
    Location :  E25056        Type: Dry Contact
